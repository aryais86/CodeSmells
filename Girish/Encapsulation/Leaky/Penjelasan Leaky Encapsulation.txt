In the code provided, there is a leaky encapsulation code smell because the getlist() method of the ToDoList class returns a direct reference to the internal list vector. This allows external code to modify the internal state of the ToDoList object without going through the appropriate methods, breaking encapsulation.
To address this issue, we can refactor the code to return a deep copy of the list vector instead of the original reference. This way, modifications to the returned copy won't affect the internal state of the ToDoList.
In the refactored code, the getList() method returns a new ArrayList object that contains deep copies of the ToDo items in the internal list vector. This ensures that modifications to the returned list won't affect the original objects stored in the ToDoList class.
