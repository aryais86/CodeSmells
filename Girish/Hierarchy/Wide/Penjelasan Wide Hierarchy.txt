In the code provided, there is a wide hierarchy code smell where the Charmander class directly inherits from a Pokemon class. To address this issue, we can introduce an intermediate abstract class called IntermediatePokemon that represents a specific category of Pokémon, such as a starter Pokémon. The Charmander class can then inherit from the IntermediatePokemon class.
In the refactored code, we introduce an IntermediatePokemon class as an intermediate level in the hierarchy between the Pokemon base class and specific Pokémon types like Charmander. The IntermediatePokemon class can have its own specific attributes and methods, while inheriting common attributes from the Pokemon base class. By introducing the IntermediatePokemon class, we create a more structured and narrower hierarchy for Pokémon types. The Charmander class can now inherit from IntermediatePokemon and provide its own implementation for specific behaviors.
