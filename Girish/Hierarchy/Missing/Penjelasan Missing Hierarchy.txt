In the code provided, there is a missing hierarchy issue where the implementation of attacks is tightly coupled with specific Pokémon types. To address this issue, we can introduce an abstract class called Pokemon that represents a generic Pokémon. Each specific Pokémon type, such as Charmander, Mudkip, and Treecko, can extend the Pokemon class and provide their own attack logic.
With this refactoring, each Pokémon type can extend the Pokemon class and implement their own attack logic, eliminating the need for multiple if statements checking the target type. The attack method is now abstract in the Pokemon class, and each subclass can override it with their specific attack behavior. Additionally, the move set generation and move selection are now handled within the Pokemon class, allowing for cleaner and more maintainable code.
